# Lotto App
A small React lotto app that allows for the creation of Lotteries of variable size and number limit, and to generate new numbers.

## What I Learned
The purpose of this project was to increase my familiarity and teach me State design in React with Downward Data Flow. Parent Lottery holds all state while Lottery Balls are dumb components that get updated from the parent component.
